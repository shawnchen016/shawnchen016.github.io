		<h2>About me and my love for computers.</h2>
		<p>
		<p>When I was around 12 years old (circa 2000), we had an old Dell desktop computer. One day, a storm blew in, and lightning struck our house. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the computer plugged into a surge protector, and the lightning fried the motherboard. At the time, the younger me didn’t understand what had happened—all I knew, and all anyone in the house knew, was that the computer didn’t work anymore. It was labeled as trash.</p>
		<p>Curiosity got the better of me, so I asked my father for permission to take it apart. He agreed, and as I carefully opened the computer and looked at all its inner parts, I had a moment of clarity: <i>this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.</i></P>
		<p>Soon after, we got a new computer, but I held onto the old one. Determined to learn more, I took it to the school tech specialist, who didn’t mind looking at it. He patiently explained what each part did and even showed me a custom-built computer in a plexiglass case that he used for testing. I was absolutely captivated. It was like a spark had ignited a fire in me.</p>
		<p>Fast forward a few years to 2007: a freshly graduated Shawn, eager to get out of his parents’ house and carve out his independence. College or trade school wasn’t on my radar then. Instead, I believed law enforcement would be the fastest way to make good money and get my own place.</p>
		<p>That decision led me on a 17-year journey, bouncing from job to job, joining the United States Army, and eventually returning to law enforcement. But throughout those years, that 12-year-old version of me was always there, whispering in the back of my mind, <i>Remember when? Remember when you fell in love with tech?</i></p>
		<p>Through a series of fortunately unfortunate events, I finally listened. Here I am now—enrolled in multiple certificate programs through Coursera, building the skills and knowledge I need to begin this next chapter of my life. It feels like I’ve come full circle, back to that spark of excitement I felt as a kid taking apart an old computer.</p>

		<h3>What are my next educational steps?</h3>
		<p>In my current position, I am faced with many choices to sort through. I know that I want to pursue a career in the Tech Industry, however, I'm not sure where I want this path to ultimately end up. I have a few different options floating around in the ocean of my mind, but a few that stand out to me are;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Starting my own computer repair business.</li>
				<li>Going into software coding and design</li>
				<li>Going into Ethical Hacking</li>
			<ul>
